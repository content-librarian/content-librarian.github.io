# Content Librarian tools

Building a collection of tools. Trying to share some things that have made my job easier.

Lots of redundancies and things that could benefit from writing shared functions and classes instead of copy-pasting and tweaking for each particular job. This is just stuff I do when I've got time, and I don't have enough time to do it that way. Some of these are attempts to share barebones versions of python scripts I've written with people who don't know python. In these cases, I'm using the smallest amount of javascript needed to make the page interactive and to run the python script, and then within the confines of the python available in the browser. Not always user friendly, and requires things to be the way I expect them to be.
